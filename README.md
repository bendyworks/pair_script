# pear
Configures the git author to a list of developers when pair programming

## Usage:

    $ pair ryalnd mathias (Sets the author to 'Matt Gauger and Ryland Herrick')
    $ pair                (Unsets the author so the git global config takes effect)

You may also set more than two users in the pair:

    $ pair bigtiger devn mathias (Sets the author to 'Jim Remsik, Devin Walters and Matt Gauger')

## Thanks
